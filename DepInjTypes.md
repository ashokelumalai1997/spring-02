# Dependency Injection types
## Constructer based :  
Dependencies are set by creating the Bean using constructer

## Setter based :  
Dependencies are set by calling setter methods on your beans

## Field :
No setter or constructor. Dependency is injected using reflection

Spring team suggests constructor injection always - simple and easy to use - @AutoWired not mandatory
